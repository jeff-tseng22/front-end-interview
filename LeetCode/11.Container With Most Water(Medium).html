    <title>Container With Most Water</title>
</head>
<body>
    <pre>
        You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
        Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
        Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
        Notice that you may not slant the container.

        Example 1:
        Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        Output: 49
        Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
        
        Example 2:
        Input: height = [1,1]
        Output: 1

        Constraints:
        n == height.length
        2 <= n <= 105
        0 <= height[i] <= 104
    </pre>

        var maxArea = function (height) {
            let result = 0;

            let i = 0;
            let j = height.length - 1;

            while (i !== j) {
                let left = height[i];
                let right = height[j];
                let h = Math.min(left, right);

                result = Math.max(result, h * (j - i));
                left >= right ? j-- : i++;
            }

            console.log(result);
            return result;
        };

            // var arr = [1,2,3,2,1];
            var arr = [5,2,5,2,1];
            maxArea(arr);
