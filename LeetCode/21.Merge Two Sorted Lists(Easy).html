    <title>21. Merge Two Sorted Lists</title>
</head>
<body>
    <pre>
        https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/
        You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
        Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
        Return the head of the merged linked list.
        Example 1:
        Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
        Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

        Example 2:
        Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
        Output: []

        Example 3:
        Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
        Output: [0]

        Constraints:
        The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
        -100 <= Node.val <= 100
        Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
